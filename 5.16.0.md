### New
- Added the `sdkData` property to the `paymentMethod` object. For Advanced flow integrations, it is strongly recommended to include this property in your `/payments` request.
- For Google Pay, added the `allowedIssuerCountryCodes` and `blockedIssuerCountryCodes` configurations which you can use to allow/block cards issued in the provided countries.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue where components were recreated and lost their state when the app returned from the background.




### Deprecated
- The following fields are now deprecated and have been moved to the new sdkData property:
  - `supportNativeRedirect` in `PaymentComponentData`
  - `checkoutAttemptId` in `PaymentMethod`
  - `threeDS2SdkVersion` in `CardPaymentMethod`
