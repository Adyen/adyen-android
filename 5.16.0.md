### New
- In the `paymentMethod` object:  `sdkData` has been added. 
   For Advanced flow integrations, we highly recommend that you include this in your `/payments` request.
- For Google Pay: you can now allow or block cards issued in specific countries. To do this, use the `allowedIssuerCountryCodes` and `blockedIssuerCountryCodes` configuration properties.

### Fixed
- For Components: when the shopper puts your app into the background and returns, the Components retain their state. Previously, Components were recreated and lost their state.

### Deprecated
- The following properties are now deprecated and have moved to the new `sdkData` object.

  | Property | Previous parent object |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | `supportNativeRedirect` | `PaymentComponentData` |
  | `checkoutAttemptId` | `PaymentMethod` |
  | `threeDS2SdkVersion` | `CardPaymentMethod` |
