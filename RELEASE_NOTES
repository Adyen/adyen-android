#### Android Components (V3)
Version 3.x.x is a completely new way of integrating payments using the Checkout API (payments/) with our UI Components or Drop-in.
It is not compatible with the integrations of version 2.x.x, which used the SDK specific API (paymentSession/).
Version 2.x.x will only receive maintenance for bug fixes, not any new features.
Check the Readme page and documentation website for more information.

- Create default Configuration Builders.
- Add UiCustomization class to 3DS2 component.
