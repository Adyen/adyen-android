### Fixed

- When the shopper uses a connected hardware keyboard, the primary button can now be selected using keyboard input. Previously, a keyboard navigation issue prevented interaction with the button.
- For Drop-in: when a shopper selects a stored payment method and a regular payment method simultaneously, a crash no longer occurs.
- For Google Pay: the availability check callback is no longer garbage collected while the check is running.
- For cards: when the card view is displayed in a bottom sheet or dialog, screen recording is no longer possible. This prevents screen recording of the card view in Drop-in. 
- Using `SessionSetupConfiguration.SERIALIZER.serialize(...)` now correctly serializes the `installmentOptions` field.
- For Sessions flow: the key is now correctly passed when obtaining a Component.

### Improved

- For Drop-in: accessibility services now correctly announce headings, providing a better experience for shoppers using screen readers.

### Changed
