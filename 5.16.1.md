### Fixed
- Resolved an accessibility issue affecting keyboard navigation on devices with a connected hardware keyboard. Users can now select the primary button using keyboard input during the payment flow.
- For drop-in, clicking on a stored payment method and a regular payment method simultaneously no longer crashes.
- For Google Pay, the availability check callback will no longer be garbage collected while the check is running.
- For cards, it is no longer possible to take screen recordings when the card view is used in a bottom sheet or dialog. This means screen recordings of the card view in drop-in are no longer possible.
- Using `SessionSetupConfiguration.SERIALIZER.serialize(...)` now correctly serializes the `installmentOptions` field
- The key is properly passed when trying to obtain a component while using sessions

### Improved
- For drop-in, heading are now correctly announced by accessibility services
