## New 
- Payment method: [PayTo](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/payto/), with support for recurring payments. 

## Fixed 
- For 3D Secure 2, the subsequent challenges after an initial failed challenge can still be completed successfully. Previously, the subsequent challenges failed automatically.
