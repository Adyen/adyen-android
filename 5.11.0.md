## Fixed
- For Drop-in:
  - [Predictive back navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/custom-back/predictive-back-gesture) is disabled to be compatible with Android 16.
  - When the payment form loads, the first input field is now automatically in focus.
- When an analytics event fails to be tracked, because the Component was cleared unexpectedly, Drop-in/Components no longer crashes.
- For the address lookup feature, the full country name in the **Search for your address** field is now shown. Previously, the country code was shown.

## Improved
- For Card Component: when the shopper enters the details for a co-badged card, they can now see the available brand options in a separate section in the payment form.

### Changed
- Dependency versions:
  | Name | Version |
  |------|---------|
  | [Android Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/gradle-plugin) | `8.8.0` -> `8.8.1` |
