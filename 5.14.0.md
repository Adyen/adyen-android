### Fixed
- The components requiring text input from shoppers no longer crash, resolving a compatibility issue with Material versions from `1.13.0-alpha12`.
- Now when device font is large, the input fields will expand to fit the text
- The keyboard now automatically hides when shoppers tap the Pay button.


### Changed
- For UPI, the QR code option is removed and the UPI ID input moved to a more intuitive place.

- Dependency versions:
  | Name | Version |
  |------|---------|
  | [Adyen 3DS2](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-3ds2-android/releases/tag/2.2.25) | `2.2.24` -> `2.2.25` |

### Deprecated
- The `Threeds2FingerprintAction` and `Threeds2ChallengeAction` actions are now deprecated. Use `Threeds2Action` instead.
- Configuration and configuration builder classes are now deprecated. Use `CheckoutConfiguration` instead.
- Configuration setter methods are replaced by property access syntax. For example:
```kotlin
CheckoutConfiguration(
    environment = environment,
    clientKey = clientKey,
) {
    card {
        // Deprecated
        setHolderNameRequired(true)
        // Replacement
        isHolderNameRequired = true
    }
}
```
- The `setSubmitButtonVisible` method for configuration objects is now deprecated. Instead use `CheckoutConfiguration`:
```kotlin
CheckoutConfiguration(
    ...
    isSubmitButtonVisible = false
) {
    ...
}
```
