### Fixed
- For components that require text input from the shopper, there is no longer a compatability issue with Material (from version [1.13.0-alpha12](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android/releases/tag/1.13.0-alpha12) or later) that causes a crash.
- When the device font is large, the input fields now get larger to fit the text.
- When the shopper selects the **Pay** button, the keyboard now automatically gets hidden.

### Changed
- For UPI:
  - The input field for the UPI ID is now in a more user-friendly location on the screen.
  - The option to pay by QR code is removed.
- Dependency versions:
  | Name | Version |
    |------|---------|
  | [Adyen 3DS2](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-3ds2-android/releases/tag/2.2.25) | `2.2.24` -> `2.2.25` |

### Deprecated
- The `Threeds2FingerprintAction` and `Threeds2ChallengeAction` actions are now deprecated. Use `Threeds2Action` instead.
- Configuration and configuration builder classes for Drop-in, payment methods and actions are now deprecated. Use `CheckoutConfiguration` instead.
- Configuration setter methods are replaced by property access syntax. For example:
```kotlin
CheckoutConfiguration(
    environment = environment,
    clientKey = clientKey,
) {
    card {
        // Deprecated
        setHolderNameRequired(true)
        // Replacement
        isHolderNameRequired = true
    }
}
```

- The `setSubmitButtonVisible` method for configuration objects is now deprecated. Use `CheckoutConfiguration` instead:

```kotlin
CheckoutConfiguration(
    ...
    isSubmitButtonVisible = false
) {
    ...
}
```
