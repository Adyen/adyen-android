### Fixed
- For Twint with [Sessions flow](https://docs.adyen.com/online-payments/build-your-integration/#sessions-flow-a-single-api-request), setting `storePaymentMethodMode`: **enabled** now correctly stores the payment method.
- For the [address lookup feature](https://docs.adyen.com/payment-methods/cards/android-component/#address-lookup), when selecting a different address, it now correctly updates the input fields on the payment form.

### Improved
- For the address lookup feature:
  - The input is now retained when changing countries.
  - The loading spinner moved to the search bar to prevent "jumping" of the view.
  - The keyboard is now hidden when:
    - An address is selected.
    - A search query is submitted.
    - The manual entry button is selected.

### Changed
- For the address lookup feature, the address format is now two lines.
- For Google Pay, when a user cancels the flow, you now get `GooglePayCancellationException` in `onError`.
