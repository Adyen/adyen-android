## New 
- For Google Pay, added the `checkoutOption` configuration which you can use to change the submit button text shown in the Google Pay sheet. 

## Fixed 
- For card payments, the expiry date field now works correctly when the shopper leaves the app, and resumes it from the background. This fixes the known issue in `v5.12.0`. 

## Changed
