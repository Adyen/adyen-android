### Fixed
- For SEPA: when the shopper returns to the app after switching away, the component now correctly retains its previous state.
- For 3D Secure 2: if the shopper selects the **Cancel** before the challenge is displayed, the challenge is no longer displayed.
- On devices running Android 15 and later: the `onError()` callback is no longer triggered for **Await**, **QR code**, and **Twint** actions when the shopper leaves and returns to the app.

### Improved
- For PayTo: the phone number input now allows leading zeros.
- For PIX: the QR code is now displayed, and the copyable code is displayed above the **Copy code** button.
