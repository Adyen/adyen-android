### Fixed
- The SEPA component now remembers its previous state when you return to the app after switching away.
- For 3DS2, when the cancel button is clicked before the challenge is displayed, then the challenge will no longer display.
- For devices running Android 15 and above, `onError()` callback is not triggered anymore for Await, QrCode and Twint actions while in background.

### Improved
- For the PayTo payment method, the phone number input now allows leading zeros.
- For PIX, a QR code is now displayed and the copiable code is displayed above the copy button.
